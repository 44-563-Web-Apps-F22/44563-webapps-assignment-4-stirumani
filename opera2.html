    <h6 class="name">BAR. </h6> <p class="speech"> And now tell me all about this distressing
        circumstance.  How did the Grand Duke die?</p>
        <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6> <p class="speech"> He perished nobly—in a Statutory Duel.</p>
      <h6 class="name">BAR. </h6> <p class="speech">In a Statutory Duel?  But that's only a civil
        death!—and the Act expires to-night, and then he will come to
        life again!</p>
        <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6> <p class="speech">Well, no.  Anxious to inaugurate my reign by
        conferring some inestimable boon on my people, I signalized this
        occasion by reviving the law for another hundred years.</p>
        <h6 class="name">BAR. </h6> <p class="speech">For another hundred years?  Then set the merry
        joybells ringing!  Let festive epithalamia resound through these
        ancient halls!  Cut the satisfying sandwich—broach the
        exhilarating Marsala—and let us rejoice to-day, if we never
        rejoice again!</p>
        <h6 class="name">LUD.</h6> <p class="speech">But I don't think I quite understand.  We have
        already
        rejoiced a good deal.</p>
        <p class="song">SONG—ERNEST.
      
          Were I a king in very truth,
          And had a son—a guileless youth—
                In probable succession;
          To teach him patience, teach him tact,
          How promptly in a fix to act,
          He should adopt, in point of fact,
                A manager's profession.
          To that condition he should stoop
                (Despite a too fond mother),
          With eight or ten "stars" in his troupe,
                All jealous of each other!
          Oh, the man who can rule a theatrical crew,
          Each member a genius (and some of them two),
          And manage to humour them, little and great,
                Can govern this tuppenny State!</p>
